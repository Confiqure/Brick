Brick
===========

Brick is an idea I had a while ago about file encryption. A Brick is an image file composed of pixels representing a message or other data. The user can either encrypt or decrypt Bricks with this program.

Decryption includes analyzing the inputted image along with a decryption key, usually saved in another place for added security. If the Brick is meant for another party or it has expired, the program will destroy the Brick.

Encryption includes converting a message into a Brick image file along with creating a decryption key. When encrypting, the sender can choose to add a specific recipient (extra security) or specify an expiration date for the Brick message.
